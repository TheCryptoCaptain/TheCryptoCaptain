Hi, I’m @TheCryptoCaptain

## Helping crypto investors protect their capital by accurate market timing ##
I try to help long-term investors to invest early in crypto bull markets and stay safe from bear markets based on our own AI-powered sentiment analytics. Using shifts in sentiment we can detect emerging bull or bear markets early. Thus, what I offer is an early warning system helping to control the strong ups and downs of the market.

## What does CryptoCaptain offer? ##
I've been an information systems researcher at university, working on data science projects. Before this background, I developed a text mining engine to crawl, retrieve, clean up, analyze the sentiment in social media and online media related to crypto and other assets. We use this sentiment as a bull bear market indicator, helping to get early entries in emerging bear markets, doing better trades, getting less losses, and helping to stay away from bear markets. So, we run a full blown investment system with proper risk management on top of this and have a signal service but also an API for our sentiment analysis and bull bear indicator. 

## How does it work? ##
I created a text mining engine that crawls hand selected crypto online media and analyzes what is expected regarding the market development. Only when aggregating all opinions and observing shifts over time, it can be used for timing major bull and bear markets. I started creating the text mining engine 10 years ago with respect to stocks and did lots of research in university to get to a high level of precision. Over the years I migrated to commodities and crypto more recently.

## How accurate is CryptoCaptain? ##
We use machine learning for crypto analysis/opinion/recommendation text categorization in various tasks. Depending on the task, the accuracy is around 85% for sentiment and 95% for asset or topic categorization. On an aggregate level, we use sentiment for a bull-bear indicator. With this indicator we improve trading systems to have less losing trades. See our [presentation](https://cryptocaptain.com/casestudy/2021-02-19_CryptoCaptain_B2B_Presentation.pdf).

## Is there a proven track record? ##
Of course you may not believe in our backtests. So, we run a public wikifolio crypto fund since end of 2020 with a [proven invesment track record](https://www.wikifolio.com/en/int/p/cryptocaptain).

## Why use CryptoCaptain as a hodler? ##
I consider myself a crypto investor with a long time horizon. However, I lost some money in 2018, so I decided to think about an approach to early detect emerging bull and bear crypto markets. My approach to this is analyzing the market's sentiment in crypto media with my own text mining software. As a data scientist I have 10 years of experience in text and data mining. Before this background I built an information service for getting good entries and exits for the major bull markets (like now). So I bought Bitcoin at $13k and have been holding it since.
